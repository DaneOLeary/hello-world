# hello-world
My name is Dane. I'm a freelance writer, tech journalist, blogger, scientist, designer and budding web developer. I currently manage my personal website (daneoleary.com) where I write media and tech reviews, science articles, writing guides, freelance career tips, and miscellaneous goodies in addition to my personal blog. I've written for dozens of web and print publications on topics such as interior design, do-it-yourself, the social sciences, addiction and recovery, mental and emotional disorders, and lots of marketing content. Speaking of marketing, I have extensive knowledge of web marketing techniques and search engine optimization. I enjoy coffee, sunshine, Amazon, Boston, reading books by Richard Dawkins, and the pursuit of knowledge.
